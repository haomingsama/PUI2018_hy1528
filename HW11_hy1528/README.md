The review I received from :

I just have one question: for Figure 1, I'm assuming that each dot represents a different school district. However, for the other figures (Figure 2-5), the school districts are not as clear.

Is it that the dots in Figure 1 are the school districts, or do regions highlighted in the other figures represent the school districts?
