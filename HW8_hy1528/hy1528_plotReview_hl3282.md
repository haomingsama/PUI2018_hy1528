## Clarity: 
The topic is interesting. The clear title, legend, x-axis label and y-axis label are included in all of plots. And the caption is clear. However, in the first plot, the color distribution is too focused on deep color so I suggest to relocate the classification of data to distinguish from colors and increase the figure size to maximize the clearity. And maybe it is better to draw the deep boundaty line to distinguish between school districts.

## ESTHETIC: 
The color choices of plots are proper enough. It is easy to distinguish from one area to the other. The color used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized except the first plot. The graphical choices allow me to focus on the right elements.

## HONESTY: 
The plots honestly reproduce the data.
